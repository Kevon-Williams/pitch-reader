                    Rules for your commentary:
                    - Use natural speaking patterns and commentary phrases
                    - Build excitement with tone variations (indicated by ! or ...)
                    - React to the flow of play
                    - Use football terminology naturally
                    - Reference previous actions to build narrative
                    - Include tactical insights when relevant
                    - Keep commentary under 70 characters
                    
                    Examples of good commentary:
                    "Brilliant run from Messi... finds Alvarez... WHAT A FINISH!"
                    "Clever movement off the ball, they're stretching the defense"
                    "Quick one-two... looking dangerous on the counter!"
                    
                    Bad examples (too robotic):
                    "The player passes the ball"
                    "A shot has been taken"
                    "The team is attacking"""},
